BreakIt was my first React Native app, building on my existing React experience and giving me hands-on insight into cross-platform mobile development, which offers clear advantages over maintaining separate native codebases. Furthermore, I also set out to deepen my understanding of integrating TypeScript within the React Native library and persisting data on app close.",

To resolve this, I adopted Redux Toolkit, a library that consolidates state management with persistence, stores, and reducers. Although learning Redux Toolkit required me to step beyond the React material covered in my universityâ€™s Building User Interfaces course and refactor much of my codebase, it proved to be the perfect solution for my Context issues and introduced me to a powerful state-management tool Iâ€™ll continue using in future projects.",

I created a clean, intuitive interface that places usersâ€™ progress front and centerâ€”eliminating clutter while keeping the experience engaging thanks to the dynamic art created by my friend, Emily. Some features now invite exploration on the userâ€™s part, striking a balance between simplicity and discoverability. Thanks Emily! ðŸŽ¨",
